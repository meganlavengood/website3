        <p>My research primarily deals with popular music, timbre, synthesizers, and recording techniques. My methodology is presented in <a href="https://www.mtosmt.org/issues/mto.20.26.3/mto.20.26.3.lavengood.php" target="_blank">my <em>Music Theory Online </em>article “The Cultural Significance of Timbre Analysis: A Case Study in 1980s Pop Music, Texture, and Narrative.”</a> I proceed from a technical analysis of timbre via spectrograms and incorporate cultural and sociological research. I also dabble in music and media (particularly video game music). You can read more about my research on my <a href="research.html">Research page</a>.</p>

Her research primarily deals with popular music, timbre, synthesizers, and recording techniques. Her article on the iconic Yamaha DX7 electric piano sound appears in the <i>Journal of Popular Music Studies</i>, and her methodology for timbre analysis is described an article in <i>Music Theory Online</i>. Her current research project focuses on pedagogy of timbre analysis in the theory classroom. As a pedagogue, she focuses on incorporating popular music as a step toward inclusivity of music students from non-traditional backgrounds. She has headed teams that won grants to redesign GMU’s core theory curriculum to be modular instead of sequential and to substantially expand the open educational resource <i>Open Music Theory</i>.
