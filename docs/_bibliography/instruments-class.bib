	abstract = {In the soundtrack for the Sega Genesis game Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (1994), the genres represented include calypso, funk, carnival, new wave, prog rock, and more. Soundtracks for video games frequently shift genres this way, to create aesthetic themes for different levels or characters. Turning toward an account of the game’s soundtrack as a unified and continuous work, I posit that the music of Sonic the Hedgehog 3 might be understood as analogous to a series of “samples” within a polystylistic whole, following Leydon 2010. Leydon notes that instrumentation “bears the bulk of the semiotic burden” in communicating genre, but stops short of detailing how different instrumental timbres themselves might signify these genres. In my close analysis of two specific levels from Sonic the Hedgehog 3—Ice Cap Zone and Marble Garden Zone—I detail how timbre, as a musical parameter separate from instrumentation, can evoke specific intertextual and “extra”-musical associations from a listener, based on implied genres in the soundtrack. In doing this, I will show how timbre, a musical parameter that remains overlooked in a great deal of music analysis, might inform and enhance dialogue in music analyses of genre within video game music and more broadly.},

The song is best known for Tom Brumley’s pedal steel guitar solo, a quintessential example of the trademark “crying” sound of the instrument. Brumley’s steel stylings emphasize a negative interpretation of the text, and some of the most poignant elements of his remarkable solo were guided by the mechanics of the instrument. I explore the relationship between the limits and special capabilities of the pedal steel guitar, and I discuss how Brumley highlights both of these aspects in this brief yet famous solo, illustrating relationships between text and technics in this iconic recording.},

	abstract = {When listening to a piece of recorded music through headphones or stereo speakers, one hears various sound sources as though they were in a virtual space. This article establishes a methodology for analyzing vocal placement—the apparent location of a voice within this virtual space—in recent popular music. In contrast to existing analytical approaches to the analysis of virtual space that rely primarily on close listening, I provide an empirical method using digital sound-processing tools to precisely locate recorded sound sources in virtual space. Additionally, I offer a measurable way to visually display these parameters within the virtual space. After Ruth Dockwray and Allan Moore (2010), I depict the virtual space as an empty room in which sound sources are located. I position the voice in this empty room according to five parameters: (1) width (the perceived lateral space occupied by the voice); (2) pitch range (the range occupied by the voice); (3) prominence (the amplitude of the voice in relationship to other sound sources in the mix); (4) environment (the level of echo and reverberation applied to the voice); and (5) layering (supplementary vocal tracks added to the voice). To illustrate the methodology, I analyze and compare the vocal placements in Eminem’s and Rihanna’s four collaborations: “Love the Way You Lie” (2010), “Love the Way You Lie (Part II)” (2010), “Numb” (2012), and “The Monster” (2013).},

Particular attention is applied to the violin, the electric guitar and the phonographic turntable as examples. The assemblage is variable, and the same instrument can be used differently and take on different meanings depending on its place within a particular assemblage; indeed, it is the assemblage that allows us to consider devices like turntables as musical instruments even though they were not designed for such purposes.},

	abstract = {At its most basic, actor-network theory is a methodological standpoint that assumes an analytical equivalence between humans and non-humans. Since anything can be an actor, ANT has been termed a "flat ontology" or, in other words, a non-hierarchical ordering of things. ANT, in its most basic form, doesn't have any particular explanatory or predictive power (the "theory" part of the term is a misnomer), but the methodology was developed alongside a number of interrelated concepts, some of which need to be included for an analysis to be truly exemplary of ANT. Here we need to understand the roles of many kinds of actors, including marketers, distributors, and expert users, in translating between the worlds of electronics and lab equipment, and the worlds of musicians in the genres of psychedelic rock, sound design, and underground/mainstream dance music. Agency, in this conceptualization, is not to be confused with intentionality: agency is simply a property of things that make a difference/change in a particular situation, rather than a result of conscious thought or intention.},

Drawing on feminist theory, especially Susan Bordo’s concept of the body as a carrier of culture, Eidsheim explores how Callas’s voice became a site of gendered scrutiny, where vocal timbre, vibrato, and register were interpreted through the lens of bodily control and femininity. Eidsheim introduces a “critical organology” of voice—an interdisciplinary framework that considers the material, physiological, and cultural dimensions of vocal production—to challenge the reductionist view of the voice as merely an instrument shaped by body size. Through this lens, she reveals how critiques of Callas’s voice reflect broader societal anxieties about female appetite, discipline, and power. Ultimately, the article calls for a rethinking of vocal discourse that disentangles voice from entrenched gendered and bodily ideologies, advocating for a more nuanced, materially grounded, and culturally aware understanding of vocal performance.

	abstract = {In this article, I draw on public-facing sources and my violinistic experience to show how attention to performance technique illustrates three different relationships between performance and analysis. In the Largo from J.S. Bach’s Sonata No. 3 for Solo Violin (BWV 1005), multiple-stop chords, string-based affordances, and bowings in turn correspond with, contradict, and create new analytical perspectives. I first collate definitions of interpretation and technique as they relate to performance. Interpretation is non-instrument-specific and deals with decoding and expressing musical meaning; technique is instrument-specific and deals with the granular mechanics of sound production. A multiple-stop intensity model shows that changes in a violinist’s multiple-stop-based effort correspond with significant cadential markers. At the local level, the violinistic “feel” of each quadruple stop aligns with expressive aspects of harmony and form. Heinrich Schenker’s performance recommendations for the Largo’s cadences, by contrast, conflict with a violinist’s experience of how the cadences intersect with instrumental affordances. Although the two perspectives may be reconcilable, actual performances support the instrument-grounded perspective. Finally, I draw on basic bowing motions to create an analytical technique of bowing reduction. My reduction of the Largo reveals a recurring bowing-based motive, which in turn elucidates the source of a performative tension I have experienced when playing the movement. This final example reminds us that technique and interpretation—just like performance and analysis—are inevitably entangled.},

Multiple dimensions—including timbre, phonation, onset, resonance, clarity, paralinguistic effects, and loudness—create a singer’s individual vocal quality. Songs recorded and re-recorded by Lucas Silveira demonstrate the dynamic aspects associated with an ever-evolving vocal quality due to the artist’s having undergone hormone replacement therapy. The concept of quality is framed in terms of three different orientations—the physiological, acoustic, and perceptual—all of which are essential to understanding qualitative aspects of vocal delivery, more so than aspects in the domains of pitch and prosody. While sonic markers of identities are fluid social constructions rather than static essential attributes, this chapter considers how qualitative elements may signify artists’ identities and genre.},

Many reflect a structural basis in what I call “riff schemes,” organizing patterns of physical repetition and physical change made by a guitarist’s fretting hand. There are four main types, which are defined by the location of repetition within the riff (at the beginning or at the end) and whether the type of repetition is exact or altered: (1) Initial Repetition and Contrast, (2) Statement and Terminal Repetition, (3) Statement and Terminal Alteration, and (4) Model and Sequential Repetition. These schemes may also play an expressive role in song narratives of energy, intensity, and aggression, all of which are common tropes in oral histories of hardcore. In the final part of the article, I present analyses of two songs that demonstrate this use: Minor Threat’s “Straight Edge” and Black Flag’s “Rise Above.”},

	abstract = {Thus far I have considered a number of ways in which formal and informal pedagogies shape human bodies and vocal practices, focusing on timbre. First, considering classical vocal pedagogy, I showed that vocal timbre does not exist a priori but is shaped by cultural forces. I discussed that the available imagery and language are saturated with race- and gender-related power structures, thus presenting a challenge in themselves to combating such wrongs. Second, examining Marian Anderson?s opera career, I discussed how female African American opera singers are perceived through racialized layers generated by listeners, and how the segregation that ended by},

	abstract = {In this chapter, Elisabeth Le Guin explores the intimate, embodied relationship between performer and composer through a detailed analysis of the first movement of Boccherini’s Cello Sonata in E-flat Major. Framing her approach within the concept of “carnal musicology,” Le Guin argues that physical sensation and gesture—what she terms “cello-and-bow thinking”—are central to understanding both the performance and the compositional process. She examines how bodily experience, particularly the cellist’s engagement with thumb position, friction, and muscular movement, informs musical interpretation and reveals a reciprocal relationship with the composer. Through close readings of the sonata’s structure, Le Guin illustrates how Boccherini’s music invites introspection, comfort, and subtle emotional expression, often resisting virtuosic display in favor of nuanced physical and affective gestures. The chapter concludes by situating Boccherini’s work within broader historical and aesthetic contexts, proposing that his sonatas reflect a deeply personal and tactile mode of musical creation that challenges conventional notions of musical authority and interpretation.
